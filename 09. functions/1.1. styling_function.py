#! Styling Functions

''' You need to keep a few details in mind when you're styling functions. 
Functions should have descriptive names, and these names should use 
lowercase letters and underscores. Descriptive names help you and others 
understand what your code is trying to do. Module names should use these 
conventions as well.

Every function should have a comment that explains concisely what 
the function does. This comment should appear immediately after the 
function definition and use the docstring format. In a well-documented 
function, other programmers can use the function by reading only the 
description in the docstring. They should be able to trust that the code 
works as described, and as long as they know the name of the function, the 
arguments it needs, and the kind of value it returns, they should be able to 
use it in their programs.

If you specify a default value for a parameter, no spaces should be used 
on either side of the equal sign: 
e.g.
def function_name(parameter_0, parameter_1='default value')

The same convention should be used for keyword arguments in function calls:
e.g.
function_name(value_0, parameter_1='value')

PEP 8 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) recommends that you 
limit lines of code to 79 characters so every line is visible in a reasonably 
sized editor window. If a set of parameters causes a functionâ€™s definition to 
be longer than 79 characters, press ENTER after the opening parenthesis 
on the definition line. On the next line, press the TAB key twice to separate 
the list of arguments from the body of the function, which will only be 
indented one level.
Most editors automatically line up any additional lines of arguments to 
match the indentation you have established on the first line:
e.g.

def function_name(
 parameter_0, parameter_1, parameter_2,
 parameter_3, parameter_4, parameter_5):
 function body...
 
If your program or module has more than one function, you can separate each by two blank lines to make it easier to see where one function 
ends and the next one begins.

All import statements should be written at the beginning of a file. The 
only exception is if you use comments at the beginning of your file to 
describe the overall program.
