# Functions are named blocks of code designed to do one specific job.
# If you need to perform that task multiple times throughout your program, 
# you donâ€™t need to type all the code for the same task again and again; 
# you just call the function dedicated to handling that task, and the call 
# tells Python to run the code inside the function.

#* Simple function

    print("Hello!\n")
