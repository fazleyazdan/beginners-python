In this chapter, you learned how to write functions and to pass arguments 
so that your functions have access to the information they need to do their 
work. You learned how to use positional and keyword arguments, and also 
how to accept an arbitrary number of arguments. You saw functions that 
display output and functions that return values. You learned how to use 
functions with lists, dictionaries, if statements, and while loops. You also saw 
how to store your functions in separate files called modules, so your program 
files will be simpler and easier to understand. Finally, you learned to style 
your functions so your programs will continue to be well-structured and as 
easy as possible for you and others to read.

One of your goals as a programmer should be to write simple code that 
does what you want it to, and functions help you do this. They allow you to 
write blocks of code and leave them alone once you know they work. When 
you know a function does its job correctly, you can trust that it will continue 
to work and move on to your next coding task.

Functions allow you to write code once and then reuse that code as 
many times as you want. When you need to run the code in a function, all 
you need to do is write a one-line call and the function does its job. When 
you need to modify a function’s behavior, you only have to modify one 
block of code, and your change takes effect everywhere you’ve made a call 
to that function.

Using functions makes your programs easier to read, and good function names summarize what each part of a program does. 
Reading a series of function calls gives you a much quicker sense of what a program does 
than reading a long series of code blocks. 

Functions also make your code easier to test and debug. When the bulk 
of your program’s work is done by a set of functions, each of which has a 
specific job, it’s much easier to test and maintain the code you’ve written. 
You can write a separate program that calls each function and tests whether 
each function works in all the situations it may encounter. When you do 
this, you can be confident that your functions will work properly each time 
you call them.
