<!--  One advantage of functions is the way they separate blocks of code from your main program. 
When you use descriptive names for your functions, your programs become much easier to follow. 
You can go a step further by storing your functions in a separate file called a module and then importing
that module into your main program.
An import statement tells Python to make the code in a module available in the currently running program file.
Storing your functions in a separate file allows you to hide the details of 
your programâ€™s code and focus on its higher-level logic. 
It also allows you to reuse functions in many different programs. 
When you store your functions in separate files, you can share those files with other programmers without 
having to share your entire program. 
Knowing how to import functions also allows you to use libraries of functions that other programmers have written. 
There are several ways to import a module,  -->
