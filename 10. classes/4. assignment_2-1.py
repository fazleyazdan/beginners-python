# Number Served: Start with your program from Task 1 of assignment-1. 
# Add an attribute called number_served with a default value of 0. 
# Create an instance called restaurant from this class. 
# Print the number of customers the restaurant has served, and then change this value and print it again.

# Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number of 
# customers that have been served. Call this method with a new number and print the value again.

# Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment 
# the number of customers whoâ€™ve been served. Call this method with any number 
# you like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, a day of business
